Choosing and Setting Up LLM Backends for RAG Applications

This project integrates multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). Different backends can be used depending on hardware capacity, cost, and performance requirements. Below is a breakdown of the most common options and how to set them up.

🔹 1. Ollama (Local LLMs)
Ollama allows you to run models completely offline on your own machine. This is great for avoiding API costs or rate limits.
✅ Pros
•	100% offline, no API keys required.
•	No cost per request.
•	Data never leaves your machine.
⚠️ Cons
•	Limited by your local CPU/GPU and available RAM.
•	Large models (7B–13B parameters) may not run on laptops.
📥 Setup
1.	Install Ollama.
2.	Pull a model:
3.	ollama pull llama3:3b        # Lightest, runs on most machines
4.	ollama pull mistral:7b       # Better quality, needs ~8GB RAM
5.	ollama pull llama3:8b        # High quality, needs ~16GB RAM
6.	In the app’s dropdown, select the pulled model.

🔹 2. OpenAI GPT (Cloud)
OpenAI models (like GPT-4o mini, GPT-4, GPT-3.5) run on OpenAI’s servers. They are powerful and reliable, but require an API key and billing account.
✅ Pros
•	State-of-the-art reasoning and accuracy.
•	No local hardware limitations.
•	Simple integration with LangChain.
⚠️ Cons
•	Requires API key + billing (free tier is limited).
•	API quotas and rate limits may apply.
•	Data is sent to OpenAI’s servers.
📥 Setup
1.	Create an account at platform.openai.com.
2.	Generate an API key.
3.	Save it as an environment variable:
4.	setx OPENAI_API_KEY "sk-your-key-here"
5.	Restart terminal and select GPT-4o mini in the app.

🔹 3. Anthropic Claude (Cloud)
Claude (Claude 3 Sonnet, Opus, Haiku) is another high-performance model hosted by Anthropic.
✅ Pros
•	Excellent reasoning and summarization.
•	Often more efficient than GPT in long-document RAG tasks.
•	Easy LangChain integration.
⚠️ Cons
•	Requires Anthropic API key + billing.
•	API quotas.
•	Data leaves your machine.
📥 Setup
1.	Sign up at console.anthropic.com.
2.	Create an API key.
3.	Save it as:
4.	setx ANTHROPIC_API_KEY "sk-ant-your-key-here"
5.	Restart terminal and select Claude in the app.

🔹 4. Hugging Face Hub (Cloud)
The Hugging Face Hub provides thousands of open-source models (Falcon, Mistral, etc.). You can run them via API or download them locally.
✅ Pros
•	Wide variety of models (open-source).
•	Free tiers available with Hugging Face tokens.
•	Easy to experiment with new models.
⚠️ Cons
•	Free tier has rate limits.
•	Performance depends on chosen model.
•	Hosted models may be slower than OpenAI/Anthropic.
📥 Setup
1.	Create a free account at huggingface.co.
2.	Get your Access Token.
3.	Save it as:
4.	setx HF_TOKEN "hf-your-token-here"
5.	Use langchain-huggingface in your project to call Hugging Face models.

⚖️ Recommendation
•	For laptops with limited RAM: Start with llama3:3b (Ollama).
•	For maximum accuracy: Use OpenAI GPT-4o mini (requires billing).
•	For strong summarization: Try Anthropic Claude.
•	For flexibility & open-source: Hugging Face Hub models.
This flexibility means the project can run in three modes:
•	💻 Local-first (Ollama) → zero cost, offline.
•	☁️ Cloud-first (OpenAI/Claude) → best accuracy.
•	🔄 Hybrid → FAISS + embeddings locally, with a fallback to cloud LLMs.
